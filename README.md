# Crop-Selection-Base-on-Climate-and-soil
This Project is a data science project. This project uses a data set name 'Crop_recommendation' containing all the information about the environment reqiored to grow a cetain crop. 
The goal of the project is to suggest the most suitable crop for the given parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Phosphotos, Potassium, Nitrogen, Rainfall recieve.  
One the data is checked for any null or missing values a graph is plotted. 
4. Then this data is then feed to a ML model name "logistic Regression". 5. The 80% of data from data set is use as a training set and rest 20% is used as a test set this determines the precision and recall value of the model. 
This after getting a good precision our project is ready. 
** enter the climate and soil data it will give us the crop name.
